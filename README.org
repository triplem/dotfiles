#+title: README

These dotfiles are managed using [[https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi][chezmoi]].

Oh, and I do use [[https://archlinux.org/][ArchLinux]], btw.

I do also work on a couple of M$ Windoze machines. On the Windoze machines the WSL is used (Ubuntu based) to be able to use tools like eg. timewarrior.

* Tools
** [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]

** [[https://github.com/gburd/isync][mbsync]] - called isync nowadays

For timewarrior please note especially some extensions, I have written.

* Private Data

Some private Data like eg. Email-Address and real name are stored in a file called .chezmoidata.yaml. Right now the following data is contained in there

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
personal:
  name: Mareike Musterfrau
  email:
    primary: mmuster@personal.de
    secondary: muster@personal.org
    alias: analias@personal.org
#+END_SRC
