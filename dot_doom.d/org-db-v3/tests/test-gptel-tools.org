No results found.
#+end_tool
Based on the search results, I found some travel-related content in your org files:

** Travel Data Found:

1. *Travel Planning File*: There's a dedicated travel file at =/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/emacs/scimax/org-db-v3/examples/travel.org= that contains:
   - Travel and vacation planning content
   - A section on booking transportation
   - Flight information
   - Reference to vacation destination guides in an attached DOCX file

2. *Flight Itinerary*: In your department hiring files, there's mention of a flight itinerary selection.

3. *Vacation Destinations*: The travel.org file references a linked document =vacation-destinations.docx= for detailed destination guides and travel tips.

The search indicates you have some travel-related organizational structure, though the specific detailed travel data appears to be primarily in the examples folder. Would you like me to search for more specific travel terms or look in particular file patterns to find additional travel data?

Based on your org files, here's what you've written about animals:

* Your Animal Content Summary:

You have a comprehensive =animals.org= file that covers four main categories:

*/ /Large Zoo Animals/
- *African Elephants*: Described as the largest land animals with remarkable intelligence, complex matriarchal social structures, and trunks with 40,000+ muscles capable of lifting 350kg
- *Lions*: Detailed as apex predators, "kings of the jungle" (though they live in grasslands), with females doing cooperative hunting and males defending territory
- *Giraffes*: World's tallest mammals reaching 5.5 meters, with the interesting fact that their long necks have only 7 vertebrae (same as humans)

*/ /Small Pets/
- *Cats*: Independent, intelligent predators that retain wild hunting instincts despite thousands of years alongside humans
- *Dogs*: Humanity's oldest domesticated animals, descended from wolves, showing extraordinary loyalty and bred for specialized roles

*/ /Aquatic Animals/
- *Marine Mammals*: Section exists but specific details weren't captured in the search results

*/ /Birds/
- Section exists but specific content wasn't detailed in the search results

*/ /Additional Animal-Related Content/
